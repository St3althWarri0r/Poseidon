"""Order manager: the only path from a decision to a broker.

Responsibilities:
  * translate AI decisions into orders and persist them before submission;
    a crash between persist and the broker acknowledging the submit leaves
    the order in an ambiguous state (APPROVED or ERROR), which
    resume_open_orders() reconciles at startup against the broker's live
    open orders (best-effort match on client_order_id/broker_order_id):
    a match is adopted and polled, a non-match is flagged for operator
    verification rather than silently dropped or blindly resubmitted;
  * enforce operating mode (research: never submit; approval: human gate;
    autonomous: submit within risk limits);
  * run the risk engine on every order, no exceptions;
  * submit with bounded retries on retryable broker errors;
  * poll open orders to terminal state and publish fill/reject events;
  * feed execution errors to the circuit breaker.

        window to propagation latency rather than eliminating it (airtight only for
        the synchronous PaperBroker). (2) on a ``positions()`` error it fails CLOSED
