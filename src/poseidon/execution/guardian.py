"""Position guardian: enforces exit plans between review cycles.

Every AI decision that opens a position carries an exit plan (stop loss /
take profit). Without enforcement those numbers are just prose — a gap
between review cycles where nothing watches the position. The guardian
closes that gap:

  * when an entry order fills, the decision's exit plan is persisted per
    symbol;
  * on a short interval during market hours, each active plan is checked
    against a live, freshness-graded quote;
  * a breach produces an exit through the normal order-manager path — so
    it obeys the operating mode (research: notify only; approval: queued
    for the human; autonomous: executed) and still passes the risk engine;
  * plans deactivate when the position is gone, and a triggered plan does
    not retrigger.

The guardian enforces numeric stops/targets. ``time_stop`` is free text
by design (e.g. "exit before earnings") and remains the AI's job during
review cycles.
